    "The real knowledge is to know that you know nothing",
    "Have more than you show, speak less than you know",
    "Pain is temproray, regret is forever",
    "Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself",
    "What doesn't kill you makes you stonger",
    "What goes around comes around",
    "All the worldly are a black hole, you can never fill it",
    "When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with mud too",
    "Fools talk, cowards are silent, but wise men listen!",
    "Vision without execution is just hallucination",
    "Time is like a sword: if you don't cut it, it cuts you",
    "Once you carry your own water, you will learn the value of every drop",
    "Cold water feels warm when your hands are freezing"
